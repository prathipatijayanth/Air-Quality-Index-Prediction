# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction
The Air Quality
Index (AQI) is a vital instrument that offers insightful data
on the state of the air quality right now and any potential
negative consequences on health. This study employs two
datasets. One is the Wuhan city dataset, which has climatic
records from 2019/9/1 to 2020/12/29, and the other is the
Shanghai city dataset, which has records from 2021/1/1 to
2022/4/23.PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, CO, l_temp, h_temp,
temp, wet, wind, Hecto-pascal Pressure Unit (hpa), visibility,
precipitation, and cloud content are the characteristics we
used to forecast the Air Quality Index. In our paper, we
concentrated on creating models for predicting the Air Quality
Index and contrasting Long short term memory (LSTM) and
its variants. Bidirectional Long Term Short Term Memory
(BiLSTM), Stacked LSTM, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
models. Additionally, as an evolutionary feature selection
approach, we included particle swarm optimisation.
